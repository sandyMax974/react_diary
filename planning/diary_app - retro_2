Difficulties

* Importing semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css => it  would help visualising if I could apply a minimum of css

* I've separated date&time and form component, however I need to pass date&time data when the form gets submitted, so I might need to re-order them. 
=> can I pass data between components of the same level? (SORTED)


Feedbacks

* Page component => wrapper for other component (ease of change)
* Preferred BE date format: YYYY-MM-DD z0000-000
* FE American date: MM-DD-YYYY
* Date component behaviour when updating => add update property to Entry
